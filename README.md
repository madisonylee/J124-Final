# J124 Final Project: A Look Into Fertility Rates Through Data Anaylisis & Visualization 
## Madison Lee
### Data Analysis 
#### **Question 1: Which countries have had the highest fertility rates on average since 1970? Which countries have had the lowest average fertility rates?**
1. My first step in finding my answer was to create a pivot table.
2. Afterwards, I placed "Location" for the columns and "Value" for the values.
3. Then, I changed the "value summarize by" to count the average for each country.
4. Then, I changed the "sort by" under the Location to "AVERAGE of value". 
5. To find the countries with the highest average fertility rates, I changed the "order" under Location to "Descending".
#### The countries with the highest average fertility rates:

#### The countries with the lowest average fertility rates:

#### **Question 2: Since 1970 to 2021, which countries have had the highest percent change in fertility rates? Which countries had the lowest percent change?**
1. I started this question off by cleaning my data slightly to make it easier to analyze.
    1. I added a slicer into the time row to show only 1970 and 2021.

#### **Question 3: Since 1970 to 2021, which countries have had the highest percent change in fertility rates? Which countries had the lowest percent change?**
